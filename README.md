## 📘 Overview
Welcome to the **federated-learning-with-cryptographic-audit** repository. This project simulates federated learning using the Flower framework. It allows decentralized client training, focusing on secure aggregation and SHA-256 audit logging to maintain privacy and security.

## 🎯 Features
- **Decentralized Learning**: Train models without sharing sensitive data.
- **Secure Aggregation**: Safeguard the results of client models.
- **Audit Logging**: Use SHA-256 to log actions securely, ensuring trust.
- **Compatibility with Python and PyTorch**: Leverage powerful machine learning libraries.
